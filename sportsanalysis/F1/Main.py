"""
Analyzes Formula 1 race data to calculate driver performance scores and
simulates championship win probabilities using Monte Carlo simulation.

The script reads race results from a CSV file, cleans the data, calculates
various driver statistics (average finish, DNF rate, points, etc.),
assigns a score to each driver based on these stats, and then runs a
Monte Carlo simulation to estimate each driver's chance of winning a
hypothetical championship.

Assumes 'Formula1_2025Season_RaceResults.csv' is in the same directory.
