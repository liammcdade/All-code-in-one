# DataNinja

DataNinja is a terminal-based data manipulation, exploration, and transformation utility designed to provide the functionality of tools like pandas, csvkit, jq, and awk â€” but entirely in a command-line interface, with zero Python knowledge required to use it.

It allows fast, scriptable interaction with datasets across formats (CSV, JSON, Excel, SQLite, YAML), and integrates data cleaning, basic analysis, format conversion, and visualization into a single unified CLI tool.

## Features

- Modular design for easy extension and customization
- Support for multiple data formats (CSV, JSON, Excel, SQLite, YAML)
- Data cleaning and preprocessing capabilities
- Data analysis and statistical functions
- Data visualization (ASCII plots in terminal)
- Plugin architecture for specialized tasks (e.g., machine learning, geospatial analysis, SQL)
- Fully scriptable and composable in shell pipelines

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Load a file and start a session

```bash
dataninja load data.csv
```

### Show the first 10 rows

```bash
dataninja head
```

### Show info about the data

```bash
dataninja info
```

### Save the current data to another format

```bash
dataninja save output.xlsx
```

### Convert between formats

```bash
dataninja convert data.csv data.json
```

### (Planned) Data cleaning, transformation, plotting, SQL, ML, geo, and more

See `dataninja --help` for all available commands.
